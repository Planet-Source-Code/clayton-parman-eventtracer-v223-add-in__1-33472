### Description

EventTracer is a VB6 Add-In which is a versatile tool for eliminating those nearly impossible to fix bugs.

It has the ability to Trace/log viturally any amount of code to a file (instead of just to the Immediate Window). Adding Trace commands for procedures and/or variables is almost entirely automated and all Tracing can be Turned Off or On with the click of a button, making it a very fast and efficient debugging tool.

Version 2.2 includes a number of enhancements and bug fixes which make it faster and easier to use.

EventTracer also includes a very capable Error Handling module which can process custom error exceptions and Add, or Remove, procedure line numbers. It also creates and maintains multiple error logs.
